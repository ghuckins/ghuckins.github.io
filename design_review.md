# Design Review for Minimalist Redesign

After reviewing the current website design, I've identified several areas that can be modified to create a much more minimal and contemporary aesthetic while maintaining the green accent color the user likes:

## Elements to Simplify or Remove

1. **Background Pattern**
   - Remove the neuron drawing background pattern entirely for a cleaner look
   - Replace with a solid white or very light neutral background

2. **Card Design**
   - Remove box shadows from featured article cards
   - Eliminate hover effects and animations
   - Replace boxed cards with simple text entries separated by minimal dividers or whitespace

3. **Decorative Elements**
   - Remove the decorative underline after section titles
   - Eliminate borders and background colors on sections
   - Reduce or remove rounded corners and other decorative styling

4. **Typography**
   - Consider a more contemporary sans-serif font for headings
   - Reduce font weight variations
   - Increase font size contrast between headings and body text
   - Use more minimal line heights and spacing

5. **Layout Structure**
   - Increase whitespace throughout
   - Simplify the grid layout to a more linear design
   - Reduce the number of sections and visual breaks
   - Create more asymmetrical, contemporary layouts

6. **Navigation**
   - Simplify the navigation hover effects
   - Consider a more minimal header design
   - Reduce or eliminate the sticky header functionality

7. **Color Usage**
   - Keep the green accent color but use it more sparingly
   - Increase contrast between elements
   - Use a more monochromatic palette with fewer color variations

8. **Buttons and Interactive Elements**
   - Replace traditional buttons with simple text links
   - Remove background colors and borders from interactive elements
   - Use subtle underlines or color changes instead of filled buttons

9. **Footer**
   - Simplify the dark footer to a minimal light design
   - Reduce footer content to essential elements only

10. **Content Presentation**
    - Reduce the amount of descriptive text
    - Present information in a more direct, minimal way
    - Focus on typography and spacing to create hierarchy rather than decorative elements

## Contemporary Design Inspiration

For a truly minimal and contemporary design, I'll draw inspiration from:
- Modern portfolio sites that use extensive whitespace
- Contemporary typography-focused designs
- Asymmetrical layouts that feel more artistic and less structured
- Subtle animations and transitions that enhance usability without being decorative
- Monochromatic color schemes with strategic accent color usage

This redesign will focus on creating a clean, uncluttered experience that lets the content shine while maintaining a sophisticated, contemporary aesthetic.
