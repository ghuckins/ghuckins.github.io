# Redesign Concept for Grace Huckins' Website

Based on the user's feedback and the reference websites provided, I've created a redesign concept that emphasizes minimalism and contemporary design while maintaining the green accent color and incorporating subtle elements of Ramon y Cajal's work.

## Design Elements

### Typography
- Primary font: EB Garamond (a modern digital version of Garamond with excellent web performance)
- Secondary font: System sans-serif stack for navigation and UI elements
- Larger font sizes for improved readability
- Increased line height and letter spacing for a contemporary feel

### Color Palette
- Background: Clean white (#ffffff)
- Text: Deep charcoal (#333333)
- Accent: Subtle sage green (#5a8a80) - maintained from original design
- Secondary accent: Light sage (#a3c2bb) - used very sparingly

### Layout
- Extremely minimal header with name and simple navigation
- No background patterns or textures
- Generous whitespace throughout
- Simple list format for articles organized by publication
- Asymmetrical layout with strategic alignment
- No cards, boxes, or container elements
- Minimal footer with only essential contact information

### Cajal Integration
- Small, subtle Cajal drawing as a decorative element in the footer or as a small icon
- No background pattern
- Possibly as a very subtle divider element between sections

### Navigation
- Simple horizontal navigation with minimal styling
- No underlines or decorative elements until hover
- Clean, text-based links without button styling

## Page Structure

### Home Page
- Large, prominent name at top
- Brief, single-line description
- Simple list of featured articles with publication names
- Minimal footer with contact information

### Portfolio Page
- Clean list of articles organized by publication
- Simple typography-based hierarchy
- No cards, boxes or visual containers
- Publications as simple headings with articles listed below

### About Page
- Clean, single-column layout
- Possibly a small Cajal illustration as a decorative element
- Simple paragraph text with ample line height
- Contact information integrated into the text
